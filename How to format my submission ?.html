<h2>How to format my submission ?</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://github.com/zhengying-liu/autodl-contrib">Convert your own data in the AutoDL format!</a></h2>
<p><strong>You can find pre-formatted datasets in the starting kit</strong>, which you can already submit to get accustomed to the interface.</p>
<p>The dataset must be formatted in the same uniform format that was used in the AutoDL competition (details below). Your submission <strong>.zip</strong> folder must look like:</p>
<pre>dataset.zip/<br />|--dataset.data/<br />|----train/<br />|------metadata.textproto<br />|------dataset-train.tfrecord<br />|----test/<br />|------metadata.textproto<br />|------dataset-test.tfrecord<br />|--dataset.solution<br />|--metadata</pre>
<p>Be careful to zip the files directly into a single archive, not to zip a folder. The metadata file is <strong>necessary</strong>, but may be empty. The data is formatted in a generic data format based on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/datasets#consuming_tfrecord_data">TFRecords</a>, used by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>.&nbsp; It is divided in two parts: the train data is used to select and train the model, while the test data is then used to evaluate it by comparing the predictions of the model to the labels. The *.solution file <strong>must</strong> contain the one-hot encoded labels of the test examples, that will be used to compute the score of the model produced by Deep Wisdom on your task.</p>
<p>You can format your own dataset in the AutoDL data format with <a title="these tools" href="https://github.com/zhengying-liu/autodl-contrib">these tools</a>. The script `check_n_format.py` formats your dataset into the right submission structure. All you have to do is to follow the README (describing the environment and the input formats supported), run the script and zip the resulting AutoDL formatted dataset!</p>
<p>If you have <strong>unlabelled data </strong>that you would like to provide in order to make predictions on it (after training and testing), see the page 'Making predictions'. Your submission does not actually need to be filled with unlabelled data, but you have the possibility to supply it if you need to make predictions.</p>
